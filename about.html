     Nice to see you here! Let me explain first a bit about myself before I dive into my coding knowledge. I'm originally from Iran but immigrated to Germany three years ago. I studied Physics in Iran but I was always fascinated by the power and beauty of Codes and how It's growing every day more and more and becoming an essential part of our lives. My passion about learning new skills and being a part of the modern world led me to decide to become a programmer. Therefore I'm studding now computer science at university Duisburg-Essen. Along studding, I am also learning front-end development skills and many software interfaces, including Javascript, HTML, CSS, GitHub, SEO, FLexbox, Netlify Hosting, Bootstrap, Visual Studio Code, Responsive, API, and react framework. I also speak Persian, English and German. I know I have a long way to go but I'm really interested to apply what I learned so far, learn new skills, improve myself and gain experiences in this field.
